# Sofa Selling Website Page (??)
Webpage made as a task. I think it is supposed to be a page for an e-commerce website.

## Size
* Minified (index.html + styles.min.css + script.min.js) = 11 KB.
* Maxified (index.html + styles.css + script.js + images) = 962 KB.

## Tools Used
* SwiperJS for the carousel.
* HTML for markup.
* CSS for styling.

## Comments
* I did not spend too much (any) time on animations. I did think of adding some fancy GSAP animations but then again, which e-commerce websites have parallax images or spinning carousels?
* Kindly upload a higher resolution photo of a task like this next time. It was really hard to read what was written.
* Normally I would have used React but that probably would be an overkill for a single static page. Also it was not mentioned whether I was allowed to use React or not (*You have to make the above web page using HTML and CSS*) so I am playing it safe.
* Looking forward to the interview.
